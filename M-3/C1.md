# Comprehending Commands

## The Objective

To read the file named *flag* that is present in the home directory in order to obtain the flag.

## The Thought Process

As I had to read the file, I decided to use the **cat** (concatenate) command and pass the name of the file i.e. *flag* as it's argument.

## Action sequence

1. cat flag
