# Pondering Paths: Position thy self

## The objective

To execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you)

## The adventure

I tried executing the *run* program by writing it's absolute path but it gave me an error saying that I should change my directory to /var/lib/apt/lists. So, I used the **cd** command to change the cwd to /var/lib/apt/lists and then wrote the absolute path to run program in order to execute it.

## Action sequence

1. cd /var/lib/apt/lists
2. /challenge/run
