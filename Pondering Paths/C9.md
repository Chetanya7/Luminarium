# Pondering Paths: home sweet home

## The Objective

To specify an argument to /challenge/run with the following constraints:

1. It must be an absolute path
2. The path must be inside the home directory
3. Argument must be of three or less characters

## The Thought Process

I can't write a path that is inside the home directory in 3 characters if I start it with */home* so I decided to use ~ that is shorthand for it.

## Action Sequence

1. /challenge/run ~/a
