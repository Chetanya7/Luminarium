# Pondering Paths: Position elsewhere

## The objective

To execute the /challenge/run program from a specific path (which it will tell you)

## The Adventure

I tried executing the *run* program by writing it's absolute path but it gave me an error saying that I should change my directory to /home. So, I used the **cd** command to change my cwd to /home and then wrote the absolute path of run program to execute it.

## Action sequence

1. cd /home
2. /challenge/run
